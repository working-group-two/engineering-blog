# Working at Working Group Two
We want to make a huge impact in our industry and foster strong personal growth while doing it! We challenge each other, we share knowledge, and we believe in the value of difference of opinion.\\
We're a distrubted team, so we travel as often as possible between our offices to visit our colleagues (but we don't force anyone to travel if the don't want to).

Every quarter the entire company meets up for two/three days to have fun and to get to know each other better. Here we find time for events like sledding, skiing, cross-fit, karaoke, you name it!
