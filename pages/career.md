WorkingGroupTwo is here to change the Telco industry, and to do so we need more great people. Our ambition is to make your mobile subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today. For that to happen we need to change the way traditional telecom works by making telecom work the “internet way”. This includes making operators work on a platform, controlling our own technology, enabling rapid iterations and focus on the end-user experience.

We are building a core network as-a-service and as-a-platform. Our platform works across multiple underlying telco networks, and we thereby make it easier to create product innovations across operators. Furthermore, we are working to expose core network functionality through APIs, and create an eco-system for developers.

We have offices in Stockholm and Oslo. We offer competitive base compensation packages, and the opportunity to take part in the upside of the company. We are a mix between a start-up and a traditional company, we sometimes call it “start-up for grown-ups”. 

**We are hiring** in the following areas:

*   **Ops and infrastructure** specialists to help us build a secure, flexible and scalable telco grade infrastructure the Internet way (experience with AWS and Docker is helpful)
*   **Mobile** core experts that can help us bring the telco world into the Internet world
*   **Developers and product managers** with experience of building **APIs/SDKs** as products for developers
*   **Backend and front-end developers** with experience and passion for real time communication services, security, and scalable services
*   Telco engineer, strong experience from networking and trouble shooting
*   **Sales person with strong technical insight,** an industry network and the ability to generate a new industry through helping us build our next generation of partners on the platform

Having telco domain knowledge is not a requirement.
