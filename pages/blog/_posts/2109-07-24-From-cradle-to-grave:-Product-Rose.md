_“Dear friends and family, we are gathered here today to say goodbye to a dear friend of ours“_ 

It's not the most common way to start a meeting, but sometimes it's required. Humans have over centuries perfectioned rites of passage and following cultural ceremonies. 

Although we're good at marking and celebrating life stages like birth, name days, anniversaries, wedding(s), and say goodbye to loved ones at the end.  We usually don’t have the same rites of passages for products. 

## Product life cycle
As a product manager, you should always consider which features or products you can kill. 

In the basic product life cycle theory, you often experience slow pick-up, growth pains, resource constraints, and struggles, sometimes referred to as the S curve and all its challenges. You’re constantly reminded to learn, plan, design, implement, operate, and what no other product life cycle tools you’re referred to. 

You’re presented with circle after circle. Learn, iterate, implement and start all over again. Theory often fails to mention the crucial part of letting a product go. When should the product or feature leave the infinity wheel? The theory is rarely learning you when or how to say goodbye.  

In software, you have `DELETE` button and then it's gone. This is how we say goodbye to our products. 

## So why do we spend the time, wearing black and mourning over a product?
But first, why do we literally set aside time to say goodbye. 

As with all things, there’s more to it than meets the eye. Every product or feature has taken time and effort to build and maintain. Several people have been involved in everything from research, optimization, guiding users on how to use it, and continuously refining it.

_“You should respect what has been made and the people that have spent time and effort on it“_

There might be people in your team and organization that spent all their time on this specific product. Not to forget your customers who have used it, learned it and knows how it works. You have them all. Superusers, internal users, external users and users you did not think about. Some might hate it, some might love it as is. 

The only thing that’s for sure is that you always should take learnings from what you have done and remember it.

## How we say goodbye  
Back to the start; “we are gathered here today”, yes we're having an actual funeral for the product we kill. 

This provides us with time to reflect on the life it had. Which problems it was supposed to solve, honor those who conceived it, and those who used it. We reflect over key milestones and learning it gave us. 

At the end, despite having the code and product killed we keep a memory of the product. For every product we kill, we keep one memory rose, a dark rose.

## When one product disappears...
For products as with life, death should be a normal thing. We should not be afraid of killing products or features. It should be as normal as throwing out worn-out shoes from your closet. 

One of the reasons is that it provides space, time and resources to focus on something new. 

In Working Group Two it all ends with a rose. 

Hey wait… how did it all begin?
