This will be a two piece blog post. I'll start with ASN.1 and then go
over to Diameter dictionary files.

# Nitty gritty

## Modules

The purpose of an ASN.1 module is to name a collection of types and/or
value definitions.

It consist of a module reference and an optional object identifier
together with the declaration of the `DEFINITIONS` type definition.
Note that even though the object identifier is optional, it is
considered bad practice to leave it out. The reason for it being
optional is for backward compatability; it was not part of the
original ASN.1 specification.
The `DEFINITIONS` keyword usually comes together with the `BEGIN` and
`END` keywords so multiple definitions can be done. (What else is the
point of a module if not to make a collection...).

The Erlang ASN.1 compiler requires each module to be in a separate
file, but generally one ASN.1 file could contain many modules.
Usual file endings are `.asn` and `.asn1`

One example of one file many modules exist in the CAP specification
[ETSI 129.078](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129000_129099/129078/16.00.00_60/)


The ASN.1 template for a module
```
ModuleReference ObjectIdentifier
DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

END
```

### Imports

Importing types, values and other structures from other modules can be
done with the `IMPORTS` and `FROM` keywords in the beginning of the
module body.  The `IMPORTS` keyword ends with a single semicolon `;`,
and the different imported definitions are comma-separated.

The meaning of the optional `IMPLICIT TAGS` keywords I'll handle later in this post.

```
CAP-datatypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0) umts-network(1) modules(3) cap-datatypes(52) version8(7)}
DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN

IMPORTS

	Duration,
	Integer4,
	Interval,
	LegID,
	ServiceKey
FROM CS1-DataTypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) inDomain(1) in-network(1)
modules(0) cs1-datatypes(2) version1(0)}

	BothwayThroughConnectionInd,
	CriticalityType,
	MiscCallInfo
FROM CS2-datatypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) inDomain(1) in-network(1)
cs2(20) modules(0) in-cs2-datatypes(0) version1(0)}

-- ...more imports...
; -- IMPORTS end here

END -- CAP-datatypes ends here --

-- CAP-errortypes module starts here --
CAP-errortypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0) umts-network(1) modules(3) cap-errortypes(51) version8(7)}
DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN


END -- CAP-errortypes ends here --
```

The type definitions `Duration` and `LegID` above are imported from
`CS1-DataTypes` module, while `MiscCallInfo` comes from
`CS2-datatypes`.

### Exports

Exports from a module are done in a similar fashion.

If the `EXPORT` keyword is not used in a module, the ASN.1 compilers
will export all values and types from the module. It's the same as
specifying `EXPORTS ALL;`.

```
CAP-GPRS-ReferenceNumber {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0)
umts-network(1) modules(3) cap-dialogueInformation(111) version8(7)}

DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

EXPORTS
	id-CAP-GPRS-ReferenceNumber,
	cAP-GPRS-ReferenceNumber-Abstract-Syntax;

IMPORTS

	Integer4
FROM CS1-DataTypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) inDomain(1) in-network(1)
modules(0) cs1-datatypes(2) version1(0)}
;

END
```

### Comments

As can be seen in the above example one can enter comments into the
ASN.1.  Comments starts with double dash `--` and ends with either a
newline or another `--`, whichever comes first.

## Assignments

Type references must start with an uppercase letter and may not end
with a dash `-`. It must also only contain upper- and lower-case
letters, digits or dashes `-`.
The syntax for a type assignment is

```
TypeRef ::= TypeDefinition
```

For instance
```
InvokeIdType ::= INTEGER (-128..127)

CancelArg ::= CHOICE {
    invokeID        [0] InvokeID,
    allRequests     [1] NULL
}

Duration ::= INTEGER (-2..86400)

Integer4 ::= INTEGER (0..2147483647)

Interval ::= INTEGER (-1..60000)

InvokeID ::= InvokeIdType

LegID ::= CHOICE {
    sendingSideID   [0] LegType,
    -- used in operations sent from SCF to SSF
    receivingSideID [1] LegType
    -- used in operations sent from SSF to SCF
}

LegType ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(1))

ServiceKey ::= Integer4
```

Value references have a similar syntax as type references except that
value references must start with a lower-case letter, and also carry
the values type.

Syntax
```
valueRef Type ::= value
```

For example
```
leg1 LegType ::= '01'H
leg2 LegType ::= '02'H

highLayerCompatibilityLength            INTEGER ::= 2
minAChBillingChargingLength             INTEGER ::= 0
```

## Types

There are some common types, each consists of a type reference and a tag number.
The tag number is used to identify it when sending the type in the network.
The universal tags are specified in [ITU-T X.680](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.680/en)

Here is a list of the most common types

| Type              | Universal Tag Number |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| BOOLEAN           | 1                    |
| INTEGER           | 2                    |
| BIT STRING        | 3                    |
| OCTET STRING      | 4                    |
| NULL              | 5                    |
| OBJECT IDENTIFIER | 6                    |
| EXTERNAL          | 8                    |
| REAL              | 9                    |
| ENUMERATED        | 10                   |
| UTF8String        | 12                   |
| TIME              | 14                   |
| SEQUENCE (OF)     | 16                   |
| SET (OF)          | 17                   |
| NumericString     | 18                   |
| IA5String         | 22                   |
| UTCTime           | 23                   |
| GeneralizedTime   | 24                   |
| VisibleString     | 26                   |
| DATE              | 31                   |
| TIME-OF-DAY       | 32                   |
| DATE-TIME         | 33                   |
| DURATION          | 34                   |
|                   |                      |
| CHOICE            | *                    |
| SELECTION         | *                    |


The common types can be divided into simple and structured types.
Structured types are the composition of multiple types (component
types) using one of the following types and keywords `SEQUENCE`,
`SEQUENCE OF`, `SET`, `SET OF`, `CHOICE`, and/or `SELECTION`.  Note
that `CHOICE` and `SELECTION` does not [need to] have their own
universal tags, due to those consisting of only other types.

## Basic types

### BOOLEAN

The `BOOLEAN` type takes values `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```
AudibleIndicator ::= CHOICE {
	tone								BOOLEAN,
	burstList							[1] BurstList
	}

```

### NULL

The `NULL` type is basically a placeholder, where the recognition of a
value is important but the actual value is not.

In 3GPP it is similar to `BOOLEAN` in the sense that a defined `NULL`
value is considered `TRUE` and if the value is missing it is
considered `FALSE`. The reason for this is that it will take no space
when sent over the network if it is `FALSE` and the same amount of
space as `BOOLEAN` if `TRUE`.

```
CancelArg {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= CHOICE {
	invokeID							[0] InvokeID,
	allRequests							[1] NULL,
	callSegmentToCancel					[2]	CallSegmentToCancel {bound}
}
```

in this example `allRequests` can be defined (as `NULL`) or not at all.

### INTEGER

`INTEGER` takes any of the infinite set of integer values. It can also
have the additional notation that names some of the values.


```
GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= INTEGER{
	updateLocation (2),
	cancelLocation (3),
	provideRoamingNumber (4),
	noteSubscriberDataModified (5),
	resumeCallHandling (6),
	insertSubscriberData (7),
	-- rest of the named integers --
}
```

```
localvalue1 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= updateLocation
localvalue2 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= 2
localvalue3 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= -55413459
```
are all valid `GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue`s.

### ENUMERATED

`ENUMERATED` has the same interpretation as `INTEGER` but will hold
specific values only.


```
RequestedInformationType ::= ENUMERATED {
    callAttemptElapsedTime(0),
    callStopTime(1),
    callConnectedElapsedTime(2),
    calledAddress(3),
    releaseCause(30)
}
```

```
reqInfoType1 RequestedInformationType ::= callAttemptElapsedTime
reqInfoType2 RequestedInformationType ::= 0
```

are both valid values of `RequestInformationType`, while this is not:

```
notValidReqInfoType RequestedInformationType ::= 4
```

### BIT STRING

`BIT STRING` takes values that are a sequence of zero or more bits. It
can also take an additional notation that name certain bits in the bit
sequence.

```
DeferredLocationEventType ::= BIT STRING {
	msAvailable	(0) ,
	enteringIntoArea	(1),
	leavingFromArea	(2),
	beingInsideArea	(3) ,
	periodicLDR	(4)
} (SIZE (1..16))
```

```
eventType1 DeferredLocationEventType ::= (msAvailable, beingInsideArea)
eventType2 DeferredLocationEventType ::= '10010'B
eventType3 DeferredLocationEventType ::= '12'H
```

are all valid value definitions of the same bit sequence where the
first and third bits are set, and no other bits are set.  The `B` stands
for binary representation and `H` for hexadecimal representation.

### OCTET STRING

Type `OCTET STRING` takes values that are an ordered sequence of zero
or more eight-bit octets.

```
MM-Code ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (1))
```

In the same manor as `BIT STRING` both values below are valid
instances of `MM-Code`:

```
iMSI-Attach1	MM-Code ::= '00000010'B
iMSI-Attach2	MM-Code ::= '02'H
```

while

```
notValidIMSI-Attach	MM-Code ::= '10010'B
```

is not a valid value due to it not being a multiple of eight bits.

### OBJECT IDENTIFIER

The `OBJECT IDENTIFIER` type (shortened `OID`) names information
objects such as ASN.1 modules. The named information object is a node
on an object identifier tree that is managed at the international
level.

ETSI for instance is managed by ITU-T
`itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)`

<div>
    <img src="/img/blog/the-specs-behind-the-specs/etsi_asn1oidtree.gif" alt="ETSI OID tree" />
</div>

and as can see in the `Modules` example version 8 of cap-datatypes is part of ETSI.
`CAP-datatypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0) umts-network(1) modules(3) cap-datatypes(52) version8(7)}`

Other root arcs

| Root | Organization    |
| =--  | ---             |
| 0    | ITU-T           |
| 1    | ISO             |
| 2    | joint-iso-itu-t |

The labels are optional and the reference could also be written as `{0
4 0 0 1 3 52 7}`. Only positive integers are allowed including zero (0).

Another example comes from the CAP-object-identifiers module in ETSI 129.078.
```
tc-Messages	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
	{itu-t recommendation q 773 modules(2) messages(1) version3(3)}

id-CAP	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
	{itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0)
	umts-network(1) cap4(22)}

id-ac	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-CAP ac(3)}
```

`id-ac` is a child of the `id-CAP` object identifier.

### EXTERNAL

`EXTERNAL` represents a value that does not need to be specified as a
ASN.1 type. It carries information on how the data should be interpreted.

```

Unidirectional {OPERATION:Invokable, OPERATION:Returnable} ::= SEQUENCE {
  dialoguePortion  DialoguePortion OPTIONAL,
  components       ComponentPortion{{Invokable}, {Returnable}}
}

DialoguePortion ::= [APPLICATION 11] EXPLICIT EXTERNAL
```

Here the value `dialoguePortion` will have tag 11 if specified.

### REAL

Values of the type `REAL` will take a triplet of numbers (m, b, e),
where m is the mantissa (a signed number), b the base (2 or 10), and e
the exponent (a signed number).

There are also three special values it can take `PLUS-INFINITY`, 0, and `MINUS-INFINITY`.

```
theBestRealValue REAL ::= (123, 10, -2) -- 1.23
maxValue REAL ::= PLUS-INFINITY
```

### UTF8String

### NumericString

The `NumericString` takes string values which only contain 0-9 and
spaces in them.

### VisibleString

Printing character sets of international ASCII, and space

### IA5String

Used to represent ISO 646 (IA5; International Alphabet 5) characters.
The entire character set contains precisely 128 characters and are
generally equivalent to the first 128 characters of the ASCII
alphabet.

### TIME
### UTCTime
### GeneralizedTime
### DATE
### TIME-OF-DAY
### DATE-TIME
### DURATION


## Structured types

### CHOICE

### SEQUENCE (OF)

`SEQUENCE` and `SEQUENCE OF` are used for composing multiple types.


```
EventTypeSMS ::= ENUMERATED {
	sms-CollectedInfo					(1),
	o-smsFailure						(2),
	o-smsSubmission						(3),
	sms-DeliveryRequested				(11),
	t-smsFailure						(12),
	t-smsDelivery						(13)
}
MonitorMode ::= ENUMERATED {
	interrupted							(0),
	notifyAndContinue					(1),
	transparent							(2)
}

SMSEvent ::= SEQUENCE {
    eventTypeSMS   [0] EventTypeSMS,
    monitorMode    [1] MonitorMode
}

Tone ::= SEQUENCE {
    toneID         [0] Integer4,
    duration       [1] Integer4 OPTIONAL,
    ...
}
```

A value of the `SMSEvent` type have information on both `EventTypeSMS`
and `MonitorMode`. The fixed number of fields in the `SEQUENCE` type
are ordered.  Context-specific tagging (e.g. the `[0], [1], [2]` stuff
in the examples), is frequently applied for the structured types, but
one could also utilize the keywords `AUTOMATIC TAGGING` in the module
definition.



`SEQUENCE OF` on the other hand, holds an arbitrary number of fields
of a single type.

```
FilterItem ::= CHOICE {
    equality [0] AttributeValueAssertion,
    substrings [1] SEQUENCE {
    type ATTRIBUTE.&id({SupportedAttributes}),
    strings SEQUENCE OF CHOICE {
        initial [0] ATTRIBUTE.&Type
        ({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type}),
        any [1] ATTRIBUTE.&Type
        ({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type}),
        final [2] ATTRIBUTE.&Type
        ({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type}) }},
    greaterOrEqual [2] AttributeValueAssertion,
    lessOrEqual [3] AttributeValueAssertion,
    present [4] AttributeType,
    approximateMatch [5] AttributeValueAssertion,
    extensibleMatch [6] MatchingRuleAssertion
}
```

In the quite complex example above we see that the type `FilterItem`
is of type `CHOICE` and can take subtype called ``strings`. `strings`
is of type `SEQUENCE OF CHOICE` which means it can take a list of
zero, one or more of `initial`, `any` or `final`. The example is quite
complex because it also uses multiple parameterized values. see
(Automatic, Implicit, Explicit tags)[#automatic,-implicit,-explicit-tags]

We find another example in the DialoguePDUs module from
[Q.773](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.773-199706-I/en) where the
AARQ is of type `SEQUENCE`, and the third field `user-infromation` is
an `SEQUENCE OF` `EXTERNAL` type.

```
AARQ-apdu ::= [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
  protocol-version
    [0] IMPLICIT BIT STRING {version1(0)} DEFAULT {version1},
  application-context-name  [1]  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
  user-information          [30] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF EXTERNAL OPTIONAL
}
```

They are quite different in how they are used, but they are encoded in
a similar way. Some languages represent `SEQUENCE` internally as a
`struct`, and `SEQUENCE OF` as an array, but encoded they would look
quite similar.

### SET (OF)

`SET` and `SET OF` are similar to `SEQUENCE` and `SEQUENCE OF`
respectively. The difference is that the composite types are
unordered.

From `CAP-datatypes` we find an example of a `SET OF` parameterized
type with size constraint.

```
GenericNumbers {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= SET SIZE(1..bound.&numOfGenericNumbers) OF GenericNumber {bound}
```

Or an example of a value from the `TCAP-Tools` module in [Q.775](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.775-199706-I/en)

```

cancelFailed ERROR ::= {
  PARAMETER
    SET {problem   [0]  CancelProblem,
         invokeId  [1]  present < TCInvokeIdSet
    }
}
```


### SELECTION

The SELECTION type `<` is used when one want's to obtain one of the
possible subtypes of a `CHOICE` definition.

If we expand the previous example from the [SET](#set-(of))

```
cancel OPERATION ::= {
  ARGUMENT  present < TCInvokeIdSet
  ERRORS    {cancelFailed}
}

cancelFailed ERROR ::= {
  PARAMETER
    SET {problem   [0]  CancelProblem,
         invokeId  [1]  present < TCInvokeIdSet
    }
}
```

we see that the `ARGUMENT` type and the invokeId field take the type
from the `present` field in the `TCInvokeIdSet` type.

the definition of `TCInvokeIdSet` is as follows

```
InvokeId ::= CHOICE {present  INTEGER,
                     absent   NULL
}

TCInvokeIdSet ::= InvokeId(WITH COMPONENTS {
                             present  (-128..127)
                           })
```

Thus `invokeId` and `ARGUMENT` fields will take integer values which
are between -128 and 127.

Canonical Encoding Rules

Subset of BER used for X.509 digital certificates

### PER

Packed encoding rules

Most compact encoding rules, used for bandwidth conservation.

Does not send the Tag of the TLV because the order in which components
of the message occur is known.  PER also does not send the Length of
the TLV if the Value has a fixed length. Uses information from ASN.1
message description to eliminate redundant information from the Value
portion.

### OER

Octet encoding rules

Octet-oriented so all Tag-Length-Values are padded so that the length
are of multiples of 8 bits.

Fastest ASN.1 encoding

Favors encoding/decoding speed

### XER, E-XER

(Extended) XML encoding rules

### JER

JSON encoding rules
