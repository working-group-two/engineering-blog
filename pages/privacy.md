# Privacy
This page contains details about how we handle your privacy and cookies.
In short; your data is only used internally in order to improve your experience.

## Job applications

When processing your application we will have to process personal data about you. This includes
your application papers, contact information, information from references, internal assessments, and
information obtained from other sources (depending on the position you apply for).

If your application is rejected, you can choose to let us retain your information 
in case a relevant position becomes available where you might be a good fit. If you do not give us your explicit
consent to do this, all the information we have about you will be deleted when the application process is finished.

You can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us at career@wgtwo.com.

We will not transfer your personal information to others, and the information
will only be used for recruitment purposes.
