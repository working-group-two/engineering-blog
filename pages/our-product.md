Our primary customers are mobile operators.
Our mission is to improve the user experience of their subscribers,
as well as making it more affordable and easier to run a core network for the operator.
Our platform includes the functionality of
the <b uk-tooltip="title: Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server">HLR/HSS</b>,
the <b uk-tooltip="title: Mobile Switching Center">G-MSC</b>,
the <b uk-tooltip="title: IP Multimedia Subsystem">IMS stack</b>,
the <b uk-tooltip="title: Short Message Service Center">SMSC</b>
and <b uk-tooltip="title: Multimedia Service Center">MMSC</b>, and
the <b uk-tooltip="title: Package Data Network Gateway">PGW</b>.

We provide control over all the telecom elements necessary for innovation,
and we make the mobile core network programmable for operators, developers and end-users.
Our aim is to create an eco-system of partners to make  mobile connectivity much more useful.

Our business model is primarily based a monthly fee per active user, but we also have a small start-up fee,
and options for revenue sharing on additional platform products.

## Integrating with us

We work with our customers to select and integrate with the host mobile network,
as well as interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other partners.
We deliver the mobile core network as-a-service,
and integrate with partners for the remaining services.
The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the public cloud.
We will usually deploy the packet gateway locally.

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements.
