# Operators

Our primary customers are mobile operators, and we focus on the user experience of their subscribers.  

From an operator perspective we have built a full stack MVNO core network. This includes the functionality of the HLR/HSS, the MSC, the SMSC and MMSC and the PGW. This means we control the user database, the signalling and media streams related to voice, messaging and Internet connectivity. 

With control of these media and control planes we are inviting developers to help build services for end-users that are more useful and interesting. Among other innovations we have WebRTC compatibility in-built into the platform, enabling handovers between GSM networks and WebRTC end-points seamlessly.

The core network is deployed multi-tenancy from the cloud. We will usually deploy the packet gateway locally. 

We work together with our customers to integrate into the host mobile network and partners for interconnectivity, connectivity, roaming, billing and other necessary pieces. For the sake of clarity, we only deliver the mobile core network as-a-service, and partner for the rest. 

We do not own the end-users, and we do not handle the wholesale capacity agreements. We are a neutral platform for an eco-system of operators, partners and developers. 

Our business model is based on 
- An affordable start-up cost;  
- A fee per active user;
- Revenue share on additional products or services that are monetised or generate additional cost
