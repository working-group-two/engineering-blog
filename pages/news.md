## Working Group Two partners with eRate
### 12th of June, 2018

eRate and Working Group Two to partner to accelerate innovation in the mobile telco market

eRate and Working Group Two signed an agreement today where Working Group Two will be eRate’s partner for a mobile core network delivered as a service. The agreement allows eRate to expand its offer from billing and customer handling systems to include a customizable and programmable mobile core network. This will allow eRate’s customers to develop their own products and services for their end-users. 

eRate and Working Group Two are both aiming to radically enhance the pace of innovation in the mobile industry. Both parties have ambitions to create products and services that give subscribers – consumers and business users alike - increased use of their mobile subscriptions. 

The co-operation will also open a platform for third parties to build products and services for customers of eRate and Working Group Two. This attempt to create a product and eco-system across operators, borders and networks is new to the industry, and both parties are excited about the prospects of together providing a market place for developers. 

“eRate serves both IoT, m2m, consumer and business markets. With a strong set of partners and brands, we look forward to turbo-charging innovation in this market and competitiveness for eRate and eRates customers through the Working Group Two platform. Working Group Two is a perfect partner for eRates existing and future plans” says Ove Vik, CEO of eRate.

“eRate has a strong ambition to create differentiation for its customers, across segments, geographies and networks. This is an ambition we share, and eRate becomes an important partner to create strong future players that want to compete with new products and services” says Erlend Prestgard, CEO of WG2.

## Signing our Head of Engineering 
### 4th of December, 2017

We are proud and happy to announce that Daniel Petersson has decided join Working Group Two as our new Head of Engineering. 

Daniel has been working in the software industry for close to twenty years and he has spent the last ten of them working for Google. He has extensive experience in building high-performance, scalable, real-time communication systems, and he also excels at creating strong engineering teams.

In addition to leading the engineering resources in Working Group Two, Daniel will also be responsible for leading our new Stockholm office. Making Stockholm our second hub is a conscious decision as it has a strong reputation for engineering talent in WebRTC, mobile core networks and building scalable infrastructure for global companies.  

For many years, Daniel has used the “Internet way” of solving real-time communication needs. At Working Group Two he will have the opportunity to use many of the same tools, but apply them to the mobile core network layer. This is fully in line of Working Group Two’s ambition of building mobile telecom the “Internet way”.
