# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This reach has a price. Extreme standardisation, local implementations and configurations as well as decades of accumulated legacy have effectively stifled product and service innovation. Operators have largely been left with tweaking pricing, billing and bundling while leaving new products and services to come from so-called "Internet players".

Our ambition is to bridge these two worlds: Enable operators to utilise their local presence and customer relationships, while  giving them the innovation capacity of an Internet player. 

We do this in four steps: 
1. We rebuild telco the "Internet way" to make the technology stack more flexible and accessible
2. We make our software work across radio networks, enabling a platform logic
3. We open up network functionality previously hidden from view, and enable new functionality for developers
4. We build the foundation for a product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work for multiple operators in multiple geographies.

Our success is measured by end-users finding their mobile subscription much more useful.
