# What are we about?

We work to bridge the mobile telecom and Internet worlds giving mobile operators the innovation capacity of Internet players. 

We get there by making the mobile core network accessible and programmable through 
1. Rebuilding mobile telco the "Internet way" 
2. Making our core network function across radio networks
3. Opening up previously unexposed network capabilities
4. Building the foundation for a product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work across operators.

We measure our success by end-users finding their mobile subscription much more useful.
