Working Group Two gives mobile operators the innovation capacity of Internet players.
By delivering the mobile core gateway nodes as-a-service and leveraging the benefits of being cloud native,
we radically enhance the innovation capacity of operators, and in parallel dramatically reduce cost and complexity.

{% include left-right-image.html img="cloud-native.svg" title="A platform for innovation" text="
    We nurture innovation for telecom functionality by exposing APIs for Voice, Messaging, and Data.
    Operators, developers and even end-users can build apps for their subscription.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="app-ecosystem.svg" title="As-a-service" text="
    With our as-a-service offering, operators don't have to buy or install anything.
    We can easily and quickly develop and enable new features such as VoLTE, 5G, and Speech-to-text Voicemail.
    Operators only pay for what they use.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="cloud-native.svg" title="Cloud native" text="
    Our platform is virtual and can run anywhere (in any cloud, in any country).
    We don't use dedicated physical hardware, and we work with infrastructure giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
"%}

{% include left-right-image.html img="app-ecosystem.svg" title="Operator friendly" text="
    Our platform is cost efficient, and we only charge our operators for what they use.
    This business model gives new operators a great start. If our operators succeed, we succeed.
"%}

We focus on making a difference for both operators and end-users.
When we succeed in our mission, operators on our platform have more satisfied 
customers that use their mobile connectivity in new and meaningful ways.
