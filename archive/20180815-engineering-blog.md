# Engineering Blog

When the infrastructure team had its big meet-up in Trondheim in the
beginning of August, one of the ideas was to create an engineering
blog.  We already have a process for writing design documents, but
this only covers bigger system changes.  There are many more topics
that typically goes undocumented, for instance:

* That idea we discussed during lunch today.
* Summary of a talk I watched.
* The big fight about X, along with related whiteboard art.
* How we should change the some process.
* Proposal for dealing with problem Y.

An engineering blog is a good place to write down this kind of nuggets
for later reference.  So the next time you have a question like
"didn't we discuss something like this last fall?"  or "why did we do
X like that again?", you could simply have a look at the blog to find
the answer.

It could also be a good way do initiate a discussion, and keep the
record for later.  So instead of the lunch idea just fizzling out when
you are back at the office, it could be elaborated and perhaps
implemented.

Since writing a blog post should be easy, we can start out with a
familiar tool: Slack has a decent "Post" function, and allows per post
discussion threads.

So to create an engineering blog post, all you need to do is to switch
to the #engineering-blog channel, click `+` and select `Post`.  Then
make sure the title is set and and click `Share`.

Discussing a post is also easy with the regular thread facility that
we already use a lot.  Ideally the channel should only contain blog
posts on its top level.

Searching blog posts is trivial using Slack's search facility and
filtering by `in:#engineering-blog`.

So the next time you have an idea, a proposal for something, did
something cool, watched and interesting talk or basically anything
engineering related, please write it up and share it with the rest of
us!
